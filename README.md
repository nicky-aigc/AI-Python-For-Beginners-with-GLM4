## Goal
- All the materials are built on deeplearning.ai's [AI Python for Beginners series](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/ai-python-for-beginners).   
- The only goal is to make it easier for the learners for whom OpenAI API is not an option.
- Use the free GLM4 Flash API to run the [AI Python for Beginners series tutorial](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/ai-python-for-beginners) locally.

## Prerequisites
- You need to have Python and some packages Jupyter Notebook on your computer.
  - You can refer to [Installing_Python.ipynb](https://github.com/nicky-aigc/AI-Python-For-Beginners-with-GLM4/blob/main/S4/L7/Installing_Python.ipynb)
  - If one package is missing, you just pip install it    
- You need to have an `.env` file in the same directory as the tutorial notebook.  
  - The `.env` file should contain the following variables:  
  - OPENAI_API_KEY="your_zhipu_api_key" # replace "your_zhipu_api_key" with your actual ZhiPu API key.


## Get your ZhiPu API key
- to have access to the Zhihu API, go to: <https://bigmodel.cn/>  
Sign up for a free account to get your API key.

S2: AI Python for Beginners: [Automating Tasks with Python](https://github.com/nicky-aigc/AI-Python-For-Beginners-with-GLM4/tree/main/S2)  
S3: AI Python for Beginners: [Working with Your Own Data and Documents in Python](https://github.com/nicky-aigc/AI-Python-For-Beginners-with-GLM4/tree/main/S3)  
S4: AI Python for Beginners: [Extending Python with Packages and APIs](https://github.com/nicky-aigc/AI-Python-For-Beginners-with-GLM4/tree/main/S4)

## Attention!
- There are often useful things to learn in the helper_functions.py for each lesson.  
- GLM4 Flash API is free for now, if you want higher quality of the content generated by the model, you may change the `model` parameter in the `helper_functions.py`.   
- Available models can be found in <https://bigmodel.cn/dev/api/normal-model/glm-4>
