## Goal
Use the free GLM4 Flash API to run the AI Python for Beginners tutorial.

## Prerequisites
You need to have an .env file in the same directory as the tutorial notebook.
The .env file should contain the following variables:
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_zhipu_api_key" # replace "your_zhipu_api_key" with your actual Zhihu API key.

## Get your Zhihu API key
to have access to the Zhihu API, go to:https://bigmodel.cn/
and sign up for a free account to get your API key.

## Use the corresponding helper_functions.py
S1: AI Python for Beginners: Basics of AI Python Coding  
S2: AI Python for Beginners: Automating Tasks with Python  
S3: AI Python for Beginners: [Working with Your Own Data and Documents in Python](https://github.com/nicky-aigc/AI-Python-For-Beginners-with-GLM4/tree/main/S3)  
S4: AI Python for Beginners: [Extending Python with Packages and APIs](https://github.com/nicky-aigc/AI-Python-For-Beginners-with-GLM4/tree/main/S4)

## Attention!
The most useful things to learn are in the helper_functions.py for each lesson.
GLM4 Flash API is free for now, if you want higher quality of the content generated by the model, you may change the `model` parameter in the `helper_functions.py`.
Available models can be found in https://bigmodel.cn/dev/api/normal-model/glm-4
